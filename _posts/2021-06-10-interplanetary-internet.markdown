The interplanetary internet will be an advanced computer network in space with network nodes and space servers that can communicate with each other. This new internet from space will provide internet access for all areas or regions on planet Earth.

The main goals of the Interplanetary Internet platform and connected projects are to inform about sustainable space developments and to build up the central space internet platform. Internet archives and advanced networks (especially AI and supercomputers) on Earth and in space will be connected to improve the new internet. With the financial support of the nations, space industry and community the Interplanetary Internet projects can develop and offer innovative network services for the new internet for space, Earth, Mars and Moon.

The platform and projects can also inform about interesting space developments from around the world, the case we get enough support to build up the information portal and company structure. With the right support we can start more awesome startup projects, build portals and applications for the upcoming internet developments and space innovations for Earth.
